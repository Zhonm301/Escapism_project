    <p1>After the recall of memories, <br> Alice was no longer awake. She had forgotton <br> her identity, her emotions, her memories,<br> her life.<br> In the snow, she layed. <br> A warmth covered her during the <br> night and snow. </p1>
</div>
<div class="text2">
    <p3> As time passed,<br> I felt a numbness in my brain, <br>as it prevented me from remembering- <br>slowly even losing my train of thoughts.<br>Alice is no longer part of the meaning of existance. <br> There is nothing left in the <br>the world for her to do.<br>
    The only thing left <br> is the wind. <br>And snow, <br>hitting her skin as she lay in the same spot.<br>... This is the escape of Alice.</p3>
